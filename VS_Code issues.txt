Safe delete (-d)
If the branch has already been fully merged into your current branch, use:
git branch -d <branch-name>


Force delete (-D)
If the branch contains commits you donâ€™t care about (i.e. unmerged or unpushed), force deletion with:
git branch -D <branch-name>

Check your global user name and email:
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

Check your repository-specific identity (if different): If you want to check the identity for a 
specific repository (in case you've set it differently for that project), 
navigate to the repository in your terminal and use:
git config user.name
git config user.email

Configure your identity
Set your name and email so commits are properly attributed:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

  "**/.git": true
}
